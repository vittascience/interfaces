This code should probably have\r\n * been added to the top of the function, before merging and\r\n * null-removal, but was added at the bottom for now-forgotten\r\n * reasons.  See these bug investigations for a fuller discussion of\r\n * the underlying issue and some of the failures that arose because of\r\n * this incomplete/incorrect fix:\r\n *\r\n * https://github.com/google/blockly/issues/8225#issuecomment-2195751783\r\n * https://github.com/google/blockly/issues/2037#issuecomment-2209696351\r\n *\r\n * Later, in PR #1205 the original O(n^2) implementation was replaced\r\n * by a linear-time implementation, though additonal fixes were made\r\n * subsequently.\r\n *\r\n * In August 2024 a number of significant simplifications were made:\r\n *\r\n * This function was previously called from Workspace.prototype.undo,\r\n * but the mutation of events by this function was the cause of issue\r\n * #7026 (note that events would combine differently in reverse order\r\n * vs. forward order).  The originally-chosen fix for this was the\r\n * addition (in PR #7069) of code to fireNow to post-filter the\r\n * .undoStack_ and .redoStack_ of any workspace that had just been\r\n * involved in dispatching events; this apparently resolved the issue\r\n * but added considerable additional complexity and made it difficult\r\n * to reason about how events are processed for undo/redo, so both the\r\n * call from undo and the post-processing code was removed, and\r\n * forward=true was made the default while calling the function with\r\n * forward=false was deprecated.\r\n *\r\n * At the same time, the buggy code to reorder BlockChange events was\r\n * replaced by a less-buggy version of the same functionality in a new\r\n * function, enqueueEvent, called from fireInternal, thus assuring\r\n * that events will be in the correct order at the time filter is\r\n * called.\r\n *\r\n * Additionally, the event merging code was modified so that only\r\n * immediately adjacent events would be merged.
